# Air-Canvas project
Computer vision project implemented with OpenCV

Ever wanted to draw your imagination by just waiving your finger in air. In this post we will learn to build an Air Canvas which can draw anything on it by just capturing the motion of a coloured marker with camera. Here a blue coloured object in hand is used as the marker.

We will be using the computer vision techniques of OpenCV to build this project. The preffered language is python due to its exhaustive libraries and easy to use syntax but understanding the basics it can be implemented in any OpenCV supported language.
